# practicalvm

This repo contains all of the scripts used in Practical Vulnerability Management (No Starch Press, 2020)

## `book-scripts` folder
This folder contains code listings **as they appear in the published book**. These scripts are also prepended with their listing IDs as used in the book.

Scripts in the root directory of the repo may have been changed (and hopefully improved) since the book was published.
